    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WHxenruSEWvrNTndakZwkP-1200-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>Based on a manga series started in 2009 by Hajime Isayama, Attack on Titan’s initial premise revolves around humanity’s perpetual war against the monstrous Titans that lurk just outside the walls of civilization.

        Following the death of his mother at a Titan’s hands (and jaws), a boy named Eren decides to fight back. What follows is an anime series that is filled with heart-pounding action, nerve-jangling moments of horror, and a body count that would make Game of Thrones blush.It stands taller than most anime for its continued ability to metamorphosize amid some truly shocking twists. What began as a seemingly standard ‘man vs. monster’ anime later transformed into a deeper exploration of morality, revenge, and whether someone should be defined by their history’s sins. Essential viewing for all anime fans, especially now the show has come to a close.</p>

    <h3>Chainsaw Man</h3>
    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNVgdYLv8i4U4viwCTDPDC-1200-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>Few anime arrived with as much hype as Chainsaw Man, and few delivered on expectations as effortlessly as the adaptation of Tatsuki Fujimoto's stylish manga.

        Chainsaw Man revolves around a down-on-his-luck hero named Denji who, thanks to a bizarre twist of fate, is suddenly reborn as a demon-human with the power to transform into a chainsaw-wielding fiend.
        
        What Chainsaw Man lacks in subtlety, it more than makes up for with its brutal action, gang of wildly entertaining cast members, and a cinematic eye that lampoons everything from Quentin Tarantino to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.
        
        With a Chainsaw Man movie on the way, there's no better time to jump into the story of Denji and his lovable chainsaw pooch, Pochita.</p>

    <h3>Cowboy Bebop</h3>
    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUFDUmCwmrceissv5E6fei-1200-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>The short-lived Netflix live-action series may have soured some on the property, but there’s a reason why Cowboy Bebop is almost always seen as shorthand for ‘classic anime.’

        The show’s legendary 26-episode run fuses creator Hajime Yatate’s effortless eye for action with composer Yoko Kanno’s kinetic jazz soundtrack. The end result? As the show puts it, in tongue-in-cheek fashion: "The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called… Cowboy Bebop."
        
        It has every right to be that confident. The story follows Spike Spiegel and his motley crew of bounty hunters as they attempt to snare some of the galaxy’s most wanted criminals in the hope of some woolongs and a warm meal.
        
        Each episode explodes in a burst of color and chaos as Spike, the stoic Jet, hair-trigger Faye, energetic Ed, and uber-smart dog Ein move towards their next target in frenetic fashion. Beneath it all, it’s tinged with a sense of melancholy, each member of the Bebop crew trapped by their tragic pasts. There’s never been a show quite like this. Many have tried to replicate its sense of coolness and charm. All have failed.</p>

    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L5UDw9bAaCfVBvkFRWE94J-970-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>Cyberpunk 2077 landed with a disappointing thud upon its release in 2020. The Netflix anime adaptation Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, set before the events of the CD Projekt Red game, helped form a major part of one of gaming's unlikeliest comeback stories.

        A breezy 10 episode limited series sees luckless student David Martinez head into the murkier depths of Night City to become an 'edgerunner', a jack-of-all trades fixer who can live on the edge and lend a hand to some of the dystopian megacity's seedier elements.
        
        Along the way, David meets several 'chooms', including netrunner Lucy. It's this relationship that forms the beating heart of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, but Studio Trigger wisely wraps it up in an impossibly cool setting, flashy animation, and a story filled with megacorps and criminal conspiracies that surprisingly stings hardest when you least expect it to. A true modern classic.</p>

    <h3>Death Note</h3>
    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2PBCAQMR8CNSzsQmFhheWE-970-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>If you’re a newcomer to anime and don’t know where to begin, start with Death Note. Not only is the English dub just as good as the subtitled version (a real rarity), it’s got one of the most recognizable and 'Western' of arcs: good-guy-turned-bad, in the vein of a Breaking Bad or Ozark.

        Light Yagami is a teenager who happens across the titular ‘Death Note’, a notebook that allows its user to kill anyone anonymously just by writing down their name. Light uses this power to bump off some of Japan’s most hardened criminals and, inevitably, starts to dream a little bigger.
        
        As the net closes in on Light, a compelling cat-and-mouse game between himself and master detective L ensues. A breathless drama that will have you hooked until its very last scene, Death Note deserves to be spoken of in the same breath as some of television’s most talked-about prestige dramas.</p>

    <h3>Delicious in Dungeon</h3>
    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L8hoSfMhbKDDvu7xbdMpgT-970-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>Anime food always looks so good, but nothing quite whets the appetite like Delicious in Dungeon, the fantasy anime with a twist.

        Based on Ryōko Kui's manga, Delicious in Dungeon follows the journey of a party of D&D-style adventurers as they aim to save one of their own. Along the way, perma-curious swordsman Laois and a motley crew of mages, warriors, and locksmiths cook up a storm by making meals out of the dungeon's creepiest, crawliest denizens.
        
        Always endearing and frequently laugh-out-loud funny, Delicious in Dungeon stands out as one of the best new anime we've seen in years.</p>

    <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jeBLVd8Kd84nceczLrPe3W-970-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>Demon Slayer is the most popular anime on the planet right now – and for good reason: it boasts some of the most exciting and hard-hitting fight scenes ever committed to screen. Animation studio Ufotable has always been renowned for its mastery of action, but it soars past its own lofty standards here.

        In the hit anime, Tanjiro seeks revenge for his family’s death at the hands of demons, leading him down a path to become a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. Throughout Tanjiro’s journey, he butts heads with fearsome demons from the Demon Moon clan.
        
        Like most of the best anime, Demon Slayer juggles its intensity with a sprinkling of genuine side-splitting moments. Tanjiro’s companions Zenitsu (a cowardly warrior who can only fight when he’s asleep) and Inosuke (a hot-headed boy who wears the head of a boar) are always on hand to keep things from ever getting too maudlin. The real highlight here is the show's brutal and balletic demon-versus-demon-slayer showdowns. They’re worth the price of admission alone.</p>

    <h3>Dragon Ball</h3>
    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cWLvA2RsjcVGNJazMEPhXT-970-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>Dragon Ball (Japanese: ドラゴンボール, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru) is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected in 42 tankōbon volumes by its publisher Shueisha. Dragon Ball was originally inspired by the classical 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts films. Dragon Ball characters also use a variety of East Asian martial arts styles, including karate[1][2][3] and Wing Chun (kung fu).[2][3][4] The series follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.

        Toriyama's manga was adapted and divided into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed 21 animated feature films and three television specials.</p>

    <h3>Fate/Zero </h3>
    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JpvMy9jVT583W6FgHa29XU-970-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>The Fate/stay night series is a sprawling universe that centers around the Holy Grail, a mythical object that allows whoever obtains it to have their wishes fulfilled. But it’s not that easy. Every few generations, magic users – known as Masters – clash in a battle royale-style conflict to get their hands on the Grail. They’re aided in that crusade by Servants, legendary warriors pulled from the pages of real-world history and legends, such as Gilgamesh and King Arthur.

        Fate/Zero is the perfect starting point for the series. Acting as a prequel to the Fate/stay night anime, the Fourth Holy Grail War features mage assassin Kiritsigu waging war against his fellow Masters. It all culminates in a breakneck rush of entertaining action and plot twists that almost demand the show be binged in one sitting. The best thing? If you like it, there are several movies and series in the Fate universe for you to dive into next</p>

    <hr/>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW9C4dmhBsCWUPYzCFZ9pQ-970-80.jpg.webp">
    <p>Haikyu follows the trials and tribulations of Hinata, a pint-sized volleyball player at Karasuno High harboring lofty ambitions to be the world’s best. The magic of Haikyu, though, is that you don’t need to be a fan of volleyball – or sport at all, really – to enjoy it. The show slowly builds up your understanding of the game alongside Hinata, and each season usually climaxes in epic matches that stand alongside any shonen anime in terms of raw emotion.

        As Haikyu wears on, you’ll laugh, cheer, and gasp as Karasuno’s eclectic squad – including the miserly perfectionist setter Kageyama and nervous wallflower Sugawara – suffer through the highs and lows of high school volleyball. This is the perfect entry point for those who want to try out sports anime for the first time. The series is set to draw to a close with a new movie in the near future</p>
